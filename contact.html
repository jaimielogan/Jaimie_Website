        I am so excited to be starting Galvanize in July! I come from an engineering background and recently worked as a consultant. This career path was neither challenging nor fulfilling for me, which resulted in me spending my free time completing online tutorials and starting the self-learning process of coding. I have minimal programming experience through school and internships, but was never able to spend the time I wanted to develop a full understanding. That is when I decided to apply to Galvanize to fully immerse myself and become the expert I want to be. I can't wait to learn new tips and tricks and put them to use creating fun, user-friendly webpages. My contact information is listed below, along with some minions to express my excitement!
